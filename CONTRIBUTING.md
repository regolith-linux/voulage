## Introduction

The Regolith Desktop project is consumed by users via Linux packages. These
packages are built via GitHub actions in this repository. It can be considered
a general-purpose system for building and hosting packages for Debian-based
systems.

## Terms

* `distro` - A global-level name referring to a Linux distribution (eg: `debian`,
`ubuntu`)
* `codename` - The name of a given release of a distro (eg: `focal`, `bullseye`)
* `arch` - The system architecture of target machines (eg: `amd64`, `arm64`)
* `stage` - May be one of `unstable`, `testing`, `release`. Modeled from
[Debian releases]
* `repository` - A collection of packages for a given `distro` + `codename` +
`arch` + `stage`
* `manifest` - A file containing lists of built package sets of:
`<package name> <source ref> <commit id>`

## Package Variants Supported

* Debian

### Package Builder

#### Overview

Package building starts from a root model which specifies the upstream package
repositories and source locations.  This package model specifies the following
attributes per package:

```json
"package-name": {
  "source": "https://...git",
  "ref": "..."
}
```

The builder traverses the package model and generates a manifest for each package.
This manifest is used to determine what (if anything) has been updated upstream
and needs to be built.  The package manifest is a text file with one package per
line.  The line contains:

```text
package-name git-repo-url branch commit-ref
```

The manifest is generated by simply retrieving the git ref of the upstream repo
at the specified branch.  After a manifest is generated, it is compared to the
previously generated manifest.  If there is no differences than the build is
complete (NOP).  In the case there are changes, the new manifest is committed
along with the newly built packages.

For the case that changes are found, for each package that has changed is built
and the results are committed to a target-specific repository.

#### Praxis

TBD

##### Customization

Package builds can be customized in a few ways. Customization is specified at the
`/stage/<stage>/<distro-name>/<codename>/<arch>` levels. There are two forms of
customization: module mutation and build host mutation. In the former, a JSON
file may be specified that becomes merged with the general package model before
manifest generation. This merging allows for: 

1. Additional packages to be specified for a given `stage`/`distro`/`codename`/`arch`
2. Existing packages to specify an alternate source (git url, branch, commit ref)
3. Remove a package from the general model.  This is useful when a given distro
already supplies a dependency natively.

For build host mutation, if the file `setup.sh` ([example]) is present in the
directory it is executed on the docker build host before manifest merging begins.

##### Repo Layout

| Path | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `/stage` | General package model per `target` |
| `/docs` | Documentation |
| `/.github/workflows` | The build system |

##### Build Triggers

Package builds are launched via GitHub workflow triggers.  The following events
are supported:

* Check manifest and build new packages upon:
  * Git repo push to `main`
  * Manually start build via `Actions` tab
  * Repository notification event. 1P packages specify GitHub workflows that
  signal `voulage` of a change. ([example][example-signal])

### How To

#### Implement a Package Builder

Copy `.github/scripts/ext-template.sh` to another file, implement the functions
in the shell script.  When invoking `main.sh`, pass the new extension as the
second parameter.  See `ext-debian.sh` as an example.

#### Build and Publish Locally

The script `local-build.sh` will invoke the build and packaging functions as
occurs in automation. This can be used to test packages build before committing
to git or debug problems with packages or the build system. Example:

```console
cd .github/scripts
./local-build.sh ../.. ext-debian.sh regolith-i3status-rust https://github.com/regolith-linux/regolith-i3status-rust.git debian_source focal
```
